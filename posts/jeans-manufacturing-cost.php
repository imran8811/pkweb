            <h3 class="mb-25">Fabric Manufacturing Cost</h3>
            <p>Denim jeans have become a staple in the attire. It is due to its comfort, timeless style, and rugged fabric that has made it popular over the years. Otherwise, it was used for industrial workers. Certain factors impact the <strong>jeans manufacturing cost</strong> in Pakistan. The first major factor is the fabric. From fiber to weaving, the number of overheads involved all account for in the pricing. The cost of fiber, the processing cost of fiber, yarn, yarn dyeing, weaving, finishing, all help finalize the cost per meter/yard.</p>
            <h4 class="mb-25">Calculation</h4>
            <p>When it comes to calculating the cost of jeans, there are a few elements to consider. Fabric, wash, thread, trims, embellishments, and units are all variables that play a part. Fabric and wash account for a major portion of the cost of these jeans. Since the fabric cost has been discussed, let us shift our focus to the wash. </p>
            <p>It is important to select the kind of wash which can come under your budget. A rinse-washed garment will have a lower cost than a bleached wash with a fashion element involved. Similarly, jeans populated with whiskers, chevrons, back knee whiskers will cost a bit more than jeans that are simply stonewashed. However, Pakistan’s manufacturers are all cooperative. They believe in building relations with their suppliers enough to compensate the cost based on your budget. This, of course, depends on the units as well. If the number of garments is increased then per unit cost decreases, which in turn proves beneficial for your business? At the end of the day, it highly depends on the order quantity for the pricing of jeans. If the quantity is low, then definitely the pricing would be high and vice versa. This factor also has a huge impact on the jeans manufacturing cost in Pakistan.</p>
            <p class="mb-25">The trims, thread, and accessories play a part in the final cost, as well. Each major brand from overseas nominates a supplier for their desired accessories. These nominated suppliers quote a price that is suitable for both the manufacturer and the brand. Further discussion of the supplier is continued with the manufacturer as they try to complete the order.</p>
